# Line-Following Robot Competition

Welcome to the Line-Following Robot Competition! This README provides an overview of our robot, its capabilities, and the rules of the competition.

## Competition Task

The competition involves a line-following challenge, where participants navigate their robots through a specially designed course. The goal is to complete the course in the shortest possible time while accurately following a predetermined white line on a black surface. The competition tests both programming prowess and engineering finesse as participants must balance speed and precision.

### Game Rules

Here are the key rules of the competition:

1. **Line Following**: Robots should follow the 2.5+-0.1cm (1") wide white line on a black surface, which includes curves, turns, junctions, dead ends, and variations.

2. **Boundary Compliance**: Robots must stay within the boundaries of the white line and complete the track without any human intervention. Attempts will be lost if the robot deviates significantly from the line.

3. **Junctions**: When encountering a junction, the robot should take the straight path.

4. **Dead Ends**: After a dead end, the robot should take a path that is not straight. Only T junctions will follow a dead end.

5. **Dead-End Types**: There are two types of dead ends: one is denoted by a pattern on the surface, and the other is a wall in the middle of the line (10+-0.5cm tall and 12cm wide).

6. **End Position**: The robot should stop at the end position, which is denoted by a pattern on the surface.

7. **Sensing**: Sensing the line cannot harm the arena.

## Repository Contents

This GitHub repository contains the following components for our line-following robot:

- **Code**: The source code and programming logic for our robot.
- **Documentation**: This file include the task discription, tested arena and details about sensors.
- **Media**: Images, videos and other media showcasing our robot in action.
- **Structure**:Since we didn't do any CAD design, I have added some images of our robot in different angles in here to get an idea.
